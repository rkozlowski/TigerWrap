**TigerWrap** is a schema-first code generator for SQL Server. It creates clean, strongly-typed C# wrappers for your stored procedures and enums — no ORM required.

Designed for developers who want to keep their SQL logic in the database and call it with confidence from their applications.

## ⚠️ Use With Care

**TigerWrap is a power tool**.
Like any power tool, it gives you precision, speed, and control — but if you use it carelessly, you can hurt yourself.

TigerWrap does **not** abstract away SQL. It doesn’t try to “save” you from poor design, long-running transactions, or mismatched assumptions between layers. Instead, it assumes:

- You **know your schema**.
- You **respect your stored procedures**.
- You **want clean separation** between your data logic and your application code.

> **Used wisely**, TigerWrap gives you exactly what you ask for — no more, no less.
